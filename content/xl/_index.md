RoPieee has always been about running RoonBridge and nothing else. But what if you're not using Roon? Or want to switch occassionally to different networking audio technology? Then RoPieeeXL might be for you: next to Roon you can use DLNA, Airplay® and Spotify® technology to stream audio.

And yes, RoPieee's theme ("it's not an OS, but an appliance") still holds. Configuration (if necessary at all) is done from RoPieee's known web interface, just as with RoonBridge. 

There are 2 ways to get RoPieeeXL: either download an image directly from the [Software](/software) section, or you upgrade from RoPieee directly from within the web interface (go to the 'Advanced' section).


Have fun!
