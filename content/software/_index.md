The latest RoPieee image is from 2019/07/29 and can be downloaded from [here](http://image.ropieee.org/20190729-ropieee-ose_rpi23-stable.bin)

For those that have limited bandwith there's an XZ compressed version of the image (which is about 1/3th of the original size) [here](http://image.ropieee.org/20190729-ropieee-ose_rpi23-stable.bin.xz)

If you use [Etcher](https://etcher.io) for flashing an SD card you can use this XZ compressed image *directly* without first decompressing it.

*Limitations*

- RoPieee requires a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3.
- With wireless (Pi 3) we only support DHCP.
- Pi 4 support is currently in beta. Please visit the forum for more info.
