**Introduction**

RoPieee images come in a few varieties. Because of different architectures you first need to choose between the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 or Raspberry Pi 4 family.

Secondly you can choose to download the standard image or a compressed one. The lather has the advantage of using less space (it's about 1/3th of the original size), but requires you to have some knowledge about compression. If you use [Etcher](https://etcher.io) for flashing an SD card you can use this XZ compressed image *directly* without first decompressing it.

**The latest RoPieee image is from 2019/05/18**
